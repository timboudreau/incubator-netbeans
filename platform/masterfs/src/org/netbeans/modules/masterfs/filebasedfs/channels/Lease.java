/**
 * A lease of a shared FileChannel with some read or write options, which
 * maintains position and state independent of the channel and resets the
 * channel to the appropriate state on use. Enables a file to be logically
 * opened for reading, writing or appending multiple times without the resource
 * consumption. Do not close the FileChannel instances obtained here - they are
 * managed by the FileChannelPool that created this lease.
 * <p>
 * Writes will acquire the NIO FileChannel's lock on the file, and if it is
 * already locked, will block until it is unlocked.
 * </p><p>
 * Do <b>not</b> allow FileChannel instances to escape the closure of the
 * callbacks passed to <code>use*()</code> methods, as the file channel is only
 * guaranteed to be in the expected state and not in use on another thread via
 * some other Lease instance during the period and on the thread that the
 * callback is executing within.
